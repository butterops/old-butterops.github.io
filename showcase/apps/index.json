That way, people are less likely to duplicate your work. If an issue was opened a while ago, it’s possible that it’s being addressed somewhere else, or has already been resolved, so comment to ask for confirmation before starting work. If you opened an issue, but figured out the answer later on your own, comment on the issue to let people know, then close the issue. Even documenting that outcome is a contribution to the project.

How do you find the right project? What if you don’t know how to code?\nWhat if something goes wrong?\nNot to worry! There are all sorts of ways to get involved with an open source project, and a few tips will help you get the most out of your experience.\nYou don’t have to contribute code A common misconception about contributing to open source is that you need to contribute code. In fact, it’s often the other parts of a project that are most neglected or overlooked. You’ll do the project a huge favor by offering to pitch in with these types of contributions!\nEven if you like to write code, other types of contributions are a great way to get involved with a project and meet other community members. Building those relationships will give you opportunities to work on other parts of the project.\nDo you like planning events?  Organize workshops or meetups about the project Organize the project’s conference Help community members find the right conferences and submit proposals for speaking  Do you like to design?  Restructure layouts to improve the project’s usability Conduct user research to reorganize and refine the project’s navigation or menus Put together a style guide to help the project have a consistent visual design Create art for t-shirts or a new logo  Do you like to write?  Write and improve the project’s documentation Curate a folder of examples showing how the project is used Start a newsletter for the project, or curate highlights from the mailing list Write tutorials for the project, like PyPA’s contributors did Write a translation for the project’s documentation  Do you like organizing?  Link to duplicate issues, and suggest new issue labels, to keep things organized Go through open issues and suggest closing old ones Ask clarifying questions on recently opened issues to move the discussion forward  Do you like to code?  Find an open issue to tackle Ask if you can help write a new feature Automate project setup Improve tooling and testing  Do you like helping people?  Answer questions about the project on e.g., Stack Overflow or Reddit Answer questions for people on open issues Help moderate the discussion boards or conversation channels  Do you like helping others code?  Review code on other people’s submissions Write tutorials for how a project can be used Offer to mentor another contributor.  ","description":"Want to contribute to open source?

If you start talking about llamas, while they were deep in a discussion about goldfish, they’ll probably look at you a little strangely.\nBefore jumping in blindly with your own suggestions, start by learning how to read the room. Doing so increases the chances that your ideas will be noticed and heard.\nEvery open source community is different.\nSpending years on one open source project means you’ve gotten to know one open source project. Move to a different project, and you might find the vocabulary, norms, and communication styles are completely different.\nThat said, many open source projects follow a similar organizational structure. Understanding the different community roles and overall process will help you get quickly oriented to any new project.\nA typical open source project has the following types of people:\n Author: The person/s or organization that created the project Owner: The person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository (not always the same as the original author) Maintainers: Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project (They may also be authors or owners of the project.) Contributors: Everyone who has contributed something back to the project Community Members: People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project’s direction  Bigger projects may also have subcommittees or working groups focused on different tasks, such as tooling, triage, community moderation, and event organizing. Look on a project’s website for a “team” page, or in the repository for governance documentation, to find this information.\nA project also has documentation. These files are usually listed in the top level of a repository.\n LICENSE: By definition, every open source project must have an open source license. If the project does not have a license, it is not open source. README: The README is the instruction manual that welcomes new community members to the project. It explains why the project is useful and how to get started. CONTRIBUTING: Whereas READMEs help people use the project, contributing docs help people contribute to the project. It explains what types of contributions are needed and how the process works. While not every project has a CONTRIBUTING file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to. CODE_OF_CONDUCT: The code of conduct sets ground rules for participants’ behavior associated and helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. While not every project has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to. Other documentation: There might be additional documentation, such as tutorials, walk-through, or governance policies, especially on bigger projects.  Finally, our projects use the following tools to organize discussion. Reading through the archives will give you a good picture of how the community thinks and works.\n Issue tracker: Where people discuss issues related to the project. Zenhub Synchronous chat channel: We use slack channels for casual conversation, collaboration, and quick exchanges.

It’s usually better to open a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a “WIP” (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.\nIf the project is on GitHub, here’s how to submit a pull request:\n Fork the repository and clone it locally. Connect your local to the original “upstream” repository by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from “upstream” often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. (See more detailed instructions here.) Create a branch for your edits. Reference any relevant issues or supporting documentation in your PR (for example, “Closes #37.”) Include screenshots of the before and after if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request. Test your changes! Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed. Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project. Contribute in the style of the project to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi-colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future.
