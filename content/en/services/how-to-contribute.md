If youâ€™re a new open source contributor, the process can be intimidating. How do you find the right project? What if you donâ€™t know how to code? What if something goes wrong?

Not to worry! There are all sorts of ways to get involved with an open source project, and a few tips will help you get the most out of your experience.

## You donâ€™t have to contribute code

A common misconception about contributing to open source is that you need to contribute code. In fact, itâ€™s often the other parts of a project that are most neglected or overlooked. Youâ€™ll do the project a huge favor by offering to pitch in with these types of contributions!

### Do you like planning events?

Organize workshops or meetups about the project
Organize the projectâ€™s conference
Help community members find the right conferences and submit proposals for speaking

### Do you like to design?

Restructure layouts to improve the projectâ€™s usability
Conduct user research to reorganize and refine the projectâ€™s navigation or menus, like Drupal suggests
Put together a style guide to help the project have a consistent visual design
Create art for t-shirts or a new logo, like hapi.jsâ€™s contributors did

### Do you like to write?

Write and improve the projectâ€™s documentation
Curate a folder of examples showing how the project is used
Start a newsletter for the project, or curate highlights from the mailing list
Write tutorials for the project, like PyPAâ€™s contributors did
Write a translation for the projectâ€™s documentation

### Do you like organizing?

Link to duplicate issues, and suggest new issue labels, to keep things organized
Go through open issues and suggest closing old ones
Ask clarifying questions on recently opened issues to move the discussion forward

## You can contribute code

Even if you like to write code, other types of contributions are a great way to get involved with a project and meet other community members. Building those relationships will give you opportunities to work on other parts of the project.

### Do you like to code?

Find an open issue to tackle
Ask if you can help write a new feature
Automate project setup
Improve tooling and testing

### Do you like helping people?

Answer questions about the project on e.g., Stack Overflow (like this Postgres example) or Reddit
Answer questions for people on open issues
Help moderate the discussion boards or conversation channels

### Do you like helping others code?

Review code on other peopleâ€™s submissions
Write tutorials for how a project can be used
Offer to mentor another contributor,
