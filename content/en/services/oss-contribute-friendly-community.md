Contributing to open source for the first time can be scary and a little overwhelming. Perhaps youâ€™re a code newbie or maybe youâ€™ve been coding for a while but havenâ€™t found a project you felt comfortable contributing to.

ButterOps Ecosystem helps you subscribe to your favorite projects(/) and get a new open issue from us in your inbox every day. Read blog posts and guides on [how to contribute to the projects](/), then pick one!

We think that open source projects should value civility, kindness, and patience with new developers. We encourage you to explore our [projects and corresponding code of conduct](/).

- Help review issues and fix them
- Help find and report bugs
- Answer questions by community members on [#slack](/)

## Start your OSS journey today

Our efforts are to help everyone have an empowering and welcoming first experience as they enter the world of Open Source Software (OSS)!

We believe - and we hope you do too - that learning how to code, how to think, and how to contribute to open source can empower the next generation of coders and creators. We VALUE first time contributors and we want them to know that everyone started somewhere! Start here!

## Support otherwise

- Send an e-mail thanking the developers. Be specific, tell them what you are using their software for and how it has benefited you.
- Use your favorite social media platform to spread the word.
- Write a blog post about your favorite software.
- If your favorite open source projects accept donations, send money.
- If you are employed by a company that uses open source software, see if you can convince management to sponsor some of the projects.
- Offer to match donations up to a set amount. It is amazing what social motivation can do!

The best way to give thanks is to make the open source community a place where people feel comfortable communicating.
