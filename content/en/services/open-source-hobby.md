## How can I contribute?

* Easy to do
  * Send an e-mail thanking the developers. Be specific,  tell them what you are using their software for and how it has benefited you.
  * Use your favorite social media platform to spread the word.
  * Write a blog post about your favorite software.

* Give money
    1. If your favorite open source projects accept donations, send money.
    2. If you are employed by a company that uses open source software, see if you can convince management to sponsor some of the projects.
    3. Offer to match donations up to a set amount. It is amazing what social motivation can do!

* Give time
    1. Help review patches.
    2. Help triage bugs.
    3. Answer questions on IRC, mailing lists, or [Stack Overflow](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/).

* Bonus
    If you are like me, you have at some point said harsh words to other people in the open source community. Commit to do better: Communicate with kindness and openness. The best way to give thanks is to make the open source community a place where people feel comfortable communicating.

## First Timers Only

First Timers Only - Get involved in Open Source and commit code to your first project! Friendly Open Source projects should reserve specific issues for newbies. Welcome! Let‚Äôs do some open source!

Contributing to open source for the first time can be scary and a little overwhelming. Perhaps you‚Äôre a Code Newbie or maybe you‚Äôve been coding for a while but haven‚Äôt found a project you felt comfortable contributing to.

> You can do it! Here‚Äôs how. If you have never contributed to an open source project before and you‚Äôre just getting started, consider exploring these resources.

First contributions is a hands-on tutorial that walks you through contributions workflow on github. When you complete the tutorial, you have made a contribution to the same project.

https://up-for-grabs.net is a site that aggregates (rolls up and makes easy to explore) projects that actively want help. They label those projects with things like ‚Äúup-for-grabs‚Äù, ‚Äújump-in‚Äù or ‚Äúhelp wanted.‚Äù

CodeTriage helps you subscribe to your favorite open-source projects and get a new open issue from them in your inbox every day.
Read blog posts and guides on how to contribute to an open source project, then pick one!

If you‚Äôre just getting started with tech and are considering being a social developer, we‚Äôve made a documentary training movie for you! Get Involved in Tech walks you through setting up your GitHub account, exploring StackOverflow, setting up a blog and starting to tweet!

Wondering what someone else‚Äôs first contribution was? You can easily find out any GitHub usernames ‚ÄúFirst Pull Request‚Äù here! (I think you‚Äôll find that most people‚Äôs first PRs were relatively small like Kent‚Äôs).

We think that open source projects should value civility, kindness, and patience with new developers. We encourage you to explore projects that have a published Code of Conduct.

### Yes, it‚Äôs scary. But SO rewarding!

We asked folks on Twitter what they felt when they made their first contribution to an open source project. Here are just a few of their tweets.

Some had great experiences:

Some had bad experiences. The purpose of first-timers-only is to help everyone have an empowering and welcoming first experience as they enter the world of Open Source Software (OSS)!

### Are you an OSS Project Owner?
If you are an OSS project owner, then consider marking a few open issues with the label first-timers-only. The first-timers-only label explicitly announces:

I‚Äôm willing to hold your hand so you can make your first PR. This issue is a bit easier than normal. And anyone who‚Äôs already contributed to open source isn‚Äôt allowed to touch this one!

First timer contributions are normally very small and easy (One recent first-timers-only issue was literally three lines of simple changes! And the changes were described in great detail and tested by the project maintainer). But this makes it easier for the contributor to get the hang of the contribution process rather than the contribution itself. Remember, this isn‚Äôt as much about getting your project features implemented quickly as it is about helping first timers.

Why is YAL (yet another label) like first-timers-only important? Because it makes a statement that first timers are welcome, that they are valued, and that they can start on your project! Often the hard part of getting into open source for the first time isn‚Äôt the implementation of a feature, but figuring out how to actually contribute code such that the pull request is accepted! But, oh the feeling of accomplishment when your first PR is merged!

Go label an issue or two with first-timers-only and advertise that those issues exist! Walk a newbie a week (or a month) through the process! Document the process, blog and tweet about it and encourage those first timers to do the same! And add this badge to your repo‚Äôs README:

Kent C. Dodds proposed First Timers Only to get new people to make their first contribution. Scott Hanselman blogged about Bringing Kindness Back to Open Source, so it was obvious that we team up and promote these ideas and get more folks involved in open source.

James Spencer created a great twitter account called @yourfirstpr that exists to showcase great issues that a newbie can solve in order to create ‚ÄúYour First Pull Request!‚Äù We recommend you follow @yourfirstpr and let them know if your OSS project has a first-timers-only tag and you have open issues that you‚Äôll reserve for a new contributor!

Utkarsh Upadhyay created a bot called @first_tmrs_only which tweets when a new first-timers-only issue is posted on GitHub. Follow it to stay abreast with latest first-timers-only issues!

Angie Gonzalez and Arlene Perez created a GitHub app called First Timers that automates most of the process of creating first-timers-only issues. Install the app on your repositories and commit simple changes to branches with names starting with first-timers- ‚Äì the First Timers App will turn it into a fully fledged issue with all information a first-time Open Source contributor will need to make their first pull request.

### Empower a First Timer today!
We believe - and we hope you do too - that learning how to code, how to think, and how to contribute to open source can empower the next generation of coders and creators. We VALUE first time contributors and we want them to know that everyone started somewhere! Start here!
