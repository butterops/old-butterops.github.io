> Creating and maintaining an app is a complex task but not necessarily complicated.

Every idea has a potential to attract audiences at some point. This leads us the app developers to challenges like carrying out **rapid app development**, **platform support** and **operational maintenance** all at the same time.

- We provide best industry practices of continuous product development and maintenance ['free' to any/all open source projects](/services/what-we-create).

- We are maintaining few [interesting projects](/) that need [more such contributions](/) as they are maturing.

- Many among us are curious to find out how can we be a ninja to sustain these challenges ourselves, till the idea starts earning dollars.

If you are passionate about an idea or software development and thinking about working with us, have a chat with me in [our slack workspace](/).

Or if you feel otherwise, I must say that this is already very considerate of you and wish to hear from you. Email me at team@butterops.dev.

Have fun exploring our [FAQ](/) and [Projects](/).
