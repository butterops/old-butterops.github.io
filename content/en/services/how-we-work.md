Every idea has a potential to attract audiences at some point. This leads us the app developers to challenges like carrying out **rapid app development**, **platform support** and **operational maintenance** all at the same time.

> Creating and maintaining an app is a complex task but not necessarily complicated.

ButterOps vastly simplifies local development and DevOps so you can focus on what's important; delivering value to your clients and customers.

### Easy
Get your first project rolling in minutes regardless of the tech or your operating system.

### Complete
Run almost anything, anywhere; throw away your other dev tools and use the one dev tool to rule them all.

### Battle Tested
Supported by a core group of maintainers and a growing community 10,000+ developers strong.

### Portable
Specify simple or complex dev requirements in a single config file and ship them to all your devs.

### Sane Defaults
Automatically set up normally arduous things like SSL, SSH keys, pretty urls, cross container networking, build steps, run time automation events and fast file sharing.

### Powerful Overrides
Don't like our defaults? Every part of Lando is overrideable down to the Docker Compose level. This means you get all the benefits of Lando without sacrificing any of the power of Docker.

### Free
Pay nothing.

### Open Source
See everything.


- We provide best industry practices of continuous product development and maintenance ['free' to any/all open source projects](/services/what-we-create).

- We are maintaining few [interesting projects](/) that need [more such contributions](/) as they are maturing.

- Many among us are curious to find out how can we be a ninja to sustain these challenges ourselves, till the idea starts earning dollars.

If you are passionate about an idea or software development and thinking about working with us, have a chat with me in [our slack workspace](/).

Or if you feel otherwise, I must say that this is already very considerate of you and wish to hear from you. Email me at team@butterops.dev.

Have fun exploring our [FAQ](/) and [Projects](/).
