For anything more than a typo fix, contributing to open source is like walking up to a group of strangers at a party. If you start talking about llamas, while they were deep in a discussion about goldfish, they‚Äôll probably look at you a little strangely.

Before jumping in blindly with your own suggestions, start by learning how to read the room. Doing so increases the chances that your ideas will be noticed and heard.

Every open source community is different.

Spending years on one open source project means you‚Äôve gotten to know one open source project. Move to a different project, and you might find the vocabulary, norms, and communication styles are completely different.

That said, many open source projects follow a similar organizational structure. Understanding the different community roles and overall process will help you get quickly oriented to any new project.

A typical open source project has the following types of people:

- **Author:** The person/s or organization that created the project
- **Owner:** The person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository (not always the same as the original author)
- **Maintainers:** Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project (They may also be authors or owners of the project.)
- **Contributors:** Everyone who has contributed something back to the project
- **Community Members:** People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project‚Äôs direction

Bigger projects may also have subcommittees or working groups focused on different tasks, such as tooling, triage, community moderation, and event organizing. Look on a project‚Äôs website for a ‚Äúteam‚Äù page, or in the repository for governance documentation, to find this information.

A project also has documentation. These files are usually listed in the top level of a repository.

- **LICENSE:** By definition, every open source project must have an open source license. If the project does not have a license, it is not open source.
- **README:** The README is the instruction manual that welcomes new community members to the project. It explains why the project is useful and how to get started.
- **CONTRIBUTING:** Whereas READMEs help people use the project, contributing docs help people contribute to the project. It explains what types of contributions are needed and how the process works. While not every project has a CONTRIBUTING file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT:** The code of conduct sets ground rules for participants‚Äô behavior associated and helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. While not every project has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.
- **Other documentation:** There might be additional documentation, such as tutorials, walk-through, or governance policies, especially on bigger projects.

Finally, our projects use the following tools to organize discussion. Reading through the archives will give you a good picture of how the community thinks and works.

- **Issue tracker:** Where people discuss issues related to the project. Zenhub
- **Synchronous chat channel:** We use slack channels for casual conversation, collaboration, and quick exchanges.
