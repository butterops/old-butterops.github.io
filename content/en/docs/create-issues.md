You should usually open an issue in the following situations:

- Report an error you can’t solve yourself
- Discuss a high-level topic or idea (for example, community, vision or policies)
- Propose a new feature or other project idea

Tips for communicating on issues:

- **If you see an open issue that you want to tackle**, comment on the issue to let people know you’re on it. That way, people are less likely to duplicate your work.
- **If an issue was opened a while ago**, it’s possible that it’s being addressed somewhere else, or has already been resolved, so comment to ask for confirmation before starting work.
- **If you opened an issue, but figured out the answer later on your own**, comment on the issue to let people know, then close the issue. Even documenting that outcome is a contribution to the project.
