Report an error you can’t solve yourself Discuss a high-level topic or idea (for example, community, vision or policies) Propose a new feature or other project idea Tips for communicating on issues:
If you see an open issue that you want to tackle, comment on the issue to let people know you’re on it. That way, people are less likely to duplicate your work.</description><dc:creator>measdot</dc:creator><category>git</category><category>github</category><category>issue</category></item><item><title>Know your projects</title><link>https://www.butterops.dev/docs/know-your-projects/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 10:33:41 +0900</pubDate><atom:modified>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 10:33:41 +0900</atom:modified><guid>https://www.butterops.dev/docs/know-your-projects/</guid><description>For anything more than a typo fix, contributing to open source is like walking up to a group of strangers at a party. If you start talking about llamas, while they were deep in a discussion about goldfish, they’ll probably look at you a little strangely.
Before jumping in blindly with your own suggestions, start by learning how to read the room. Doing so increases the chances that your ideas will be noticed and heard.</description><dc:creator>measdot</dc:creator><category>contributor</category><category>maintainer</category><category>license</category><category>code of conduct</category><category>issue</category><category>pull request</category></item><item><title>Submit a pull request</title><link>https://www.butterops.dev/docs/submit-pr/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 10:33:41 +0900</pubDate><atom:modified>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 10:33:41 +0900</atom:modified><guid>https://www.butterops.dev/docs/submit-pr/</guid><description>You should usually open a pull request in the following situations:
Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error) Start work on a contribution that was already asked for, or that you’ve already discussed, in an issue A pull request doesn’t have to represent finished work. It’s usually better to open a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress.</description><dc:creator>measdot</dc:creator><category>git</category><category>github</category><category>pull request</category><category>issue</category><category>branch</category></item></channel></rss>
