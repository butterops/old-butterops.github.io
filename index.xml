Report an error you can’t solve yourself Discuss a high-level topic or idea (for example, community, vision or policies) Propose a new feature or other project idea Tips for communicating on issues:
If you see an open issue that you want to tackle, comment on the issue to let people know you’re on it. That way, people are less likely to duplicate your work.</description><dc:creator>measdot</dc:creator><category>git</category><category>github</category><category>issue</category></item><item><title>How can I contribute?</title><link>https://www.butterops.dev/services/how-can-i-contribute/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 10:33:41 +0900</pubDate><atom:modified>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 10:33:41 +0900</atom:modified><guid>https://www.butterops.dev/services/how-can-i-contribute/</guid><description>If you’re a new open source contributor, the process can be intimidating. How do you find the right project? What if you don’t know how to code?
What if something goes wrong?
Not to worry! There are all sorts of ways to get involved with an open source project, and a few tips will help you get the most out of your experience.
You don’t have to contribute code A common misconception about contributing to open source is that you need to contribute code.</description><dc:creator>measdot</dc:creator><category>design</category><category>write</category><category>issues</category><category>code</category><category>meetups</category></item><item><title>Know your projects</title><link>https://www.butterops.dev/docs/know-your-projects/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 10:33:41 +0900</pubDate><atom:modified>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 10:33:41 +0900</atom:modified><guid>https://www.butterops.dev/docs/know-your-projects/</guid><description>For anything more than a typo fix, contributing to open source is like walking up to a group of strangers at a party. If you start talking about llamas, while they were deep in a discussion about goldfish, they’ll probably look at you a little strangely.
Before jumping in blindly with your own suggestions, start by learning how to read the room. Doing so increases the chances that your ideas will be noticed and heard.</description><dc:creator>measdot</dc:creator><category>contributor</category><category>maintainer</category><category>license</category><category>code of conduct</category><category>issue</category><category>pull request</category></item><item><title>Submit a pull request</title><link>https://www.butterops.dev/docs/submit-pr/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 10:33:41 +0900</pubDate><atom:modified>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 10:33:41 +0900</atom:modified><guid>https://www.butterops.dev/docs/submit-pr/</guid><description>You should usually open a pull request in the following situations:
Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error) Start work on a contribution that was already asked for, or that you’ve already discussed, in an issue A pull request doesn’t have to represent finished work. It’s usually better to open a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress.</description><dc:creator>measdot</dc:creator><category>git</category><category>github</category><category>pull request</category><category>issue</category><category>branch</category></item></channel></rss>
